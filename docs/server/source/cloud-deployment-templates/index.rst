Cloud Deployment Templates
==========================

We have some "templates" to deploy a basic, working, but bare-bones BigchainDB node on various cloud providers. They should *not* be used as-is to deploy a node for production. They can be used as a starting point.

You don't have to use the tools we use in the templates. You can use whatever tools you prefer.

If you find the cloud deployment templates for nodes helpful, then you may also be interested in our scripts for :doc:`deploying a testing cluster on AWS <../clusters-feds/aws-testing-cluster>` (documented in the Clusters section).
